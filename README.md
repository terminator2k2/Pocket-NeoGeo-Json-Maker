# Pocket-NeoGeo-Json-Maker

creates json files for NeoGeo games

copy the Assets folder onto the root of your micro sd card, then navigate to assets/ng and run PocketNeo.py

This will check your roms in assets/ng/common , and only build .Json files for the games you have in common as long as they match the romset in the script.

all files will auto delete once procedure has finished.

It will also place the game.json files in the \Assets\ng\Mazamars312.NeoGeo folder.

No other files or folders are worked in and any custom json files you have made yourself should be intact. 

Big Thank you to Timothee Groleau (timotheeg) for re-writing the script, Much appreciated
